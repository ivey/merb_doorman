merb_doorman
============

Merb plugin that provides an allow/deny DSL for controlling access


# mostly open:
# there is an implicit "allow :all" as the last rule
# rules continue to match until an allow is found, or we run out
# of rules

deny :host => "209.34.*"
deny :user => "bill"       # calls current_user.login, but this is configurable
deny :user_agent => /MSIE/
deny {|c| c.params["arbitrary"] == "expressions"}


# mostly closed:
deny :all                           # removes implicit final allow :all
allow :host => "*.example.com"
allow :time => "8am-5pm"

# store a block for repeated usage
Merb::Access.add_block :admin, {|c| c.current_user.admin?}

allow :admin
